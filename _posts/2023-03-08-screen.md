# Introduction
screen is a terminal multiplexer. It allows a user to access multiple separate terminal sessions inside a single terminal window or remote terminal session. It is useful for separating programs from the shell that started them and for detaching programs from the terminal without terminating them.

# Basic commands
The basic commands are:
1. screen -S <session_name> - start a new screen session
2. screen -ls - list all screen sessions
3. screen -r <session_name> - attach to a screen session
4. screen -d <session_name> - detach from a screen session
