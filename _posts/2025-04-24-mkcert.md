title: Generating HTTPS Certificates for Localhost with mkcert
---

When developing locally, using HTTPS can be essential for testing secure connections. However, setting up HTTPS for localhost can be challenging due to certificate trust issues. This is where `mkcert` comes in handy. In this post, I’ll walk you through how I used `mkcert` to generate an HTTPS certificate for localhost.

## What is mkcert?

`mkcert` is a simple tool that makes locally trusted development certificates. It automatically creates and installs a local Certificate Authority (CA) in your system, allowing you to generate certificates that are trusted by your browser and operating system.

## Installing mkcert

To get started, you need to install `mkcert`. On macOS, you can use Homebrew:

```bash
brew install mkcert
brew install nss # If you use Firefox
```

## Setting Up mkcert

After installation, you need to set up the local CA:

```bash
mkcert -install
```

This command creates and installs a local CA in your system’s trust store. It’s a one-time setup.

## Generating a Certificate for Localhost

To generate a certificate for `localhost`, run the following command:

```bash
mkcert localhost
```

This will create two files in the current directory:

- `localhost.pem`: The certificate file.
- `localhost-key.pem`: The private key file.

You can also generate certificates for multiple domains by specifying them as arguments:

```bash
mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
```

## Using the Certificate

Once the certificate is generated, you can use it in your local development server. For example, if you’re using a Node.js server, you can configure it like this:

```javascript
const https = require('https');
const fs = require('fs');

const options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('localhost-key.pem'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('localhost.pem')
};

https.createServer(options, (req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200);
  res.end('Hello, HTTPS!');
}).listen(443);
```

## Verifying the Setup

After starting your server, open your browser and navigate to `https://localhost`. You should see the secure connection indicator without any certificate warnings.

## Conclusion

Using `mkcert` simplifies the process of setting up HTTPS for local development. It eliminates the hassle of dealing with untrusted certificates and ensures a smooth development experience. If you haven’t tried it yet, give it a go!

I hope this guide helps you set up HTTPS for your local projects. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out!
