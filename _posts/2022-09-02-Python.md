# Introduction

I have been using *Python*, and I noticed some interesting [Pythonic](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/) way to avoid wring `for loop` and `if-else` statements

# For Loop
## List Comprehension/Generator
```python
result = []
for item in item_list:
    new_item = do_something(item)
    result.append(new_item)
```
 
This is a typical example of transforming a list of items into another, and there is a very Pythonic implementation for that
 
```python
result = [do_something(item) for item in item_list]
```

## Function
If you want to use a function to transform the list, you can use `map` function

```python
result = map(do_something, item_list)
```

For example

```python
squared = map(lambda x: x**2, range(10))
```

## Extract Functions or Generators

The above two methods are very useful when you want to extract a function or generator from a list

How about more complicated examples?

```python
results = []
for item in item_list:
    # setup

    # condition

    # processing

    # calculation
    results.append(result)
```
Obviously you are overloading a code block.

Instead, you can do:
```python
results = []
def process(item)
    # setup

    # condition

    # processing

    # calculation
    return result

results = [process(item) for item in item_list]
```

How about nested `for loop`?

```python
results = []
for item in item_list:
    for sub_item in sub_item_list:
        # setup

        # condition

        # processing

        # calculation
        results.append(result)
```
To switch it to a list comprehension, you can do:
```python
results = [process(item, sub_item)
           for item in item_list
           for sub_item in sub_item_list]
```
If you want to record some inner state of the list

```python
a = [2,8,5,6,4,3,9,7,1]
results = []
current = 0

for i in a:
    current = max(current, i)
    results.append(current)

print(results)

# [2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9]
```

We can use generator to do the same thing

```python
def max_generator(a):
    current = 0
    for i in a:
        current = max(current, i)
        yield current

a = [2,8,5,6,4,3,9,7,1]
results = list(max_generator(a))
print(results)

# [2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9]
```
Wait a minute, is there a for loop in the generator?

We could do it with `itertools.accumulate`

```python
import itertools
a = [2,8,5,6,4,3,9,7,1]
results = list(itertools.accumulate(a, max))
print(results)

# [2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9]
```

# If-Else
## Ternary Operator
```python
if condition:
    x = true_value
else:
    x = false_value
```
can be written as
```python
x = true_value if condition else false_value
```

## Probability Space
```python
if condition:
    x = true_value
else:
    x = false_value
```
can also be written as
```python
x = [false_value, true_value][condition]
```

# Conclusion
Most of the time, you don't need to write `for loop` and `if-else` statements, and you can use list comprehension, map, generator, ternary operator, and probability space to do the same thing.
