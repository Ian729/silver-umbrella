# GitHub Spider

GitHub Spider is a Python script that interacts with the GitHub API to crawl user profiles, follow users based on follower count, display user repositories, and star repositories that meet popularity criteria.

## Features

- **User Crawling**: Fetches and displays GitHub user profiles.
- **Following Users**: Automatically follows GitHub users with over 300 followers.
- **Repository Handling**: Displays and stars repositories based on popularity.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ian729/GithubSpider.git
   cd GithubSpider
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Set up your GitHub token as an environment variable:

   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=your-github-token
   ```

   Replace `your-github-token` with your actual GitHub personal access token.

2. Modify the script (`github_spider.py`) to customize crawling depth (`DEPTH_LIMIT`) and other parameters as needed.

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python github_spider.py
   ```

   The script will start crawling from a predefined GitHub user (`torvalds` by default) and follow users, display repositories, and star popular repositories.
